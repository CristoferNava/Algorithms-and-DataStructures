// The bitwise operators take operands of integral type that they use as a collection

// ~ bitwise NOT
// << >> left shift and right shift
// & bitwise AND
// ^ bitwise XOR
// | bitwise OR
// there are not guarantees for how the sign is handled, is recommendable use
// unsigned types with the bitwise operators
